# 🧠 ASL Hand Tracker (In Progress)

This project is a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) hand tracking application that uses **computer vision** and **deep learning** to detect, track, and classify hand gestures from live video input.

## 💡 Overview

The goal of this project is to build an accessible tool that leverages **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize ASL gestures from webcam footage. It aims to support real-time gesture recognition while providing an interactive user interface to visualize predictions.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is still in progress. Core functionality is under active development, and improvements to the model and UI are ongoing.
